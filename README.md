# Drone Vision

Drone Vision is a powerful API for real time flight information monitoring. You can send GPS coordinates to an API and receive detailed info about obstacles, weather conditions and no flight zones on course of your drone.

Our API allows:

* Detect terrain obstacles such as mountains, hills etc on drone's course.
* Show precise info about current weather conditions (temperature and pressure depends on altitude) and warn about possible problems.
* Warn about no flight zones.
* Show flight speed and direction.
* Check out Drone Vision App or documentation.
